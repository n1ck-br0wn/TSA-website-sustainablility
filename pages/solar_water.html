    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>These heaters use sunlight as their main source of heating using insulated solar tanks to collect heat in water.  These systems capture and circulate the thermal energy collected from the sunlight.  These usually run on a back up system of normal water heaters as there are cases where there is insufficient sun to heat the water to a stable temperature.</p>
