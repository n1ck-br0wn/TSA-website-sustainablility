    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>Using solar photovoltaic systems, these can convert the sunlight into electricity.  This can also be used as solar panels which can power household appliances, this highly depends on the amount of solar panels.  Using a solar cell these solar panels can range from 10-400watts of power.</p>
    <p>These are highly durable and can survive a multitude of weather conditions from hail to storming and extreme UV rays.  They are highly versatile and can be placed anywhere from the roof of a place to a field out in the open and can be programmed to follow the suns movement to gain maximum efficiency.</p>

    <!-- costs -->
    <h2>cost</h2>
    <p>These average a cost of $3 for each kilowatt installed.  An average household requires about 7kilowatts of energy/power a day (7000 watts) meaning it would cost about $21,000 for an average household.  It is a lot but it pays off over time.</p>
