    <!-- description of geothermal heat pumps -->
    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>are underground water sources that transfer heat from underground to the water and cycle it back into homes.  These are extremely efficient and are two to three times more efficient than commonly used air source heat pumps due to the constant heat temperatures being cycled from the ground.  These are extremely durable and can last a really long time and they can also supply hot water during any time of the year.</p>

    <h2>cost</h2>
    <p>These can be more expensive than installing normal air source heat pumps</p>
